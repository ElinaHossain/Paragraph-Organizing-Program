## What does it do?
This program allows you to organize and manipulate a paragraph of text. It takes input from the user or command line arguments to determine the number of lines in the paragraph. Then, it prompts the user to enter each line of the paragraph.
After that, it performs three operations on the paragraph:
Part 1: It formats each word to have a width of 10 characters.
Part 2: It truncates each word to have a maximum length of 10 characters.
Part 3: It sorts each line of the paragraph in ascending order, ignoring case sensitivity.
Finally, it prints the modified paragraph after each operation.
